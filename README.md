# Subsidy Distribution for Farmers

## About
This project is a side initiative aimed at efficiently distributing and providing accurate information regarding various subsidies available to farmers in different regions. It aims to empower farmers by ensuring they have easy access to critical information related to government subsidies and benefits for farming.

- **Real-time Updates:** The system can be updated regularly to reflect new government subsidies and policies.
- **Easy Navigation:** Users can filter subsidies by type, eligibility criteria, and geographical location.
- **Database Integration:** The system stores subsidy information in a structured database for easy management and retrieval.
