# Subsidy Distribution for Farmers

## About
This project is a side initiative aimed at efficiently distributing and providing accurate information regarding various subsidies available to farmers in different regions. It aims to empower farmers by ensuring they have easy access to critical information related to government subsidies and benefits for farming. Whenever any kind of benefits is available in their region, the registered farmers will immediately receive the related information,so that they can use the benefits.

The project collects, stores, and organizes subsidy information by region, helping farmers easily find subsidies they are eligible for based on their location and farming needs. The system provides a user-friendly interface for farmers to view and access this information.

- **Easy Navigation:** Users can filter subsidies by type, eligibility criteria, and geographical location.
- **Database Integration:** The system stores subsidy information in a structured database for easy management and retrieval.
